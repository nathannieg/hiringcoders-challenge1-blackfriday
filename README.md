## Overview

This challenge is part of a free of cost, 100% online education program. 10k students - out of over 30k registrations - were selected after initial tests. The program teaches front and back end techlogies as well as the soft skills most valued in today's corporate world.

### The challenge

The challenge is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript tocreate a simple black friday themed landing page that will take the user's informations and store into the local storage.

As recommended, I'll be using Netlify to host the project.

Seeing as it's a beginners project, it's not required that the landing page is responsive.
